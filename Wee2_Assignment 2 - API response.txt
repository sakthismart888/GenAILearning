                "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to convert the given Java code into Playwright TypeScript. Let me start by understanding the original Java code.\n\nThe Java code is a simple test that launches Chrome, navigates to a URL, logs in with specific credentials, and checks the title. It uses WebDriverManager to set up the ChromeDriver and Selenium for interactions.\n\nFirst, I'll consider the structure of a Playwright test. Playwright uses a test runner, so I'll need to import 'test' and 'expect' from '@playwright/test'. The example provided uses a test block with async functions and page interactions.\n\nI'll outline the steps from the Java code and map them to Playwright methods. The Java code does the following:\n\n1. Sets up ChromeDriver using WebDriverManager.\n2. Launches the browser.\n3. Navigates to the URL.\n4. Sets an implicit wait.\n5. Maximizes the window.\n6. Enters username and password.\n7. Clicks the login button.\n8. Checks the title.\n\nIn Playwright, setup is handled via the browser context, so I'll use browser.newContext() and browser.newPage() for each test to ensure isolation. I'll also set the viewport size to 1920x1080 for consistency.\n\nFor the implicit wait, Playwright doesn't have a direct equivalent, but I can use page.waitForNavigation() with a timeout. However, in the example, the user is using page.goto() and then waiting for the page to load, which is sufficient.\n\nI'll create two tests: one for successful login and another for handling invalid credentials. This follows best practices for testing different scenarios.\n\nIn each test, I'll navigate to the login page, fill in the credentials, click the login button, and then assert the outcome. For the successful login, I'll check the title. For the failed login, I'll look for an error message.\n\nI'll make sure to use proper selectors, like using name attributes for username and password fields, and a class name for the submit button. I'll also replace hard-coded values with more descriptive names, even though in the example, the user used 'DemoSalesManager' and 'crmsfa'.\n\nFinally, I'll structure the code with clear comments, explaining each step so that someone new to Playwright can understand and execute it easily. I'll ensure that the code follows best practices, such as using async/await and proper test structure.\n</think>\n\nHere's the Playwright TypeScript code converted from the given Java code, following best practices and proper naming conventions:\n\n```typescript\nimport { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';\n\n// Initialize and launch the browser with Chrome\ntest('Successful login with valid credentials', async ({ page }) => {\n  // Step 0: Set up the browser context and page\n  const browser = await playwright.chromium.launch();\n  const context = await browser.newContext({ viewportSize: { width: 1920, height: 1080 } });\n  const page = await context.newPage();\n\n  try {\n    // Step 1: Navigate to the login page\n    await page.goto('http://leaftaps.com/opentaps');\n\n    // Step 2: Set implicit wait for element loading\n    await page.waitForNavigation({ timeout: 15000 });\n\n    // Step 3: Maximize the browser window\n    await page.setViewportSize({ width: 1920, height: 1080 });\n\n    // Step 4: Enter username\n    await page.fill('input[name=\"username\"]', 'DemoSalesManager');\n\n    // Step 5: Enter password\n    await page.fill('input[name=\"password\"]', 'crmsfa');\n\n    // Step 6: Click the login button\n    await page.click('.decorativeSubmit');\n\n    // Step 7: Verify the title of the page\n    const title = await page.title();\n    expect(title).toBe('Login');\n  } finally {\n    await browser.close();\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Imports**: We import `test` and `expect` from Playwright's test module.\n2. **Browser Initialization**: We use `playwright.chromium.launch()` to start a Chromium browser instance.\n3. **Context and Page Setup**: We create a new browser context and page instance with a defined viewport size.\n4. **Navigation**: We navigate to the login page using `page.goto()`.\n5. **Implicit Wait**: We use `page.waitForNavigation()` with a timeout to ensure elements load.\n6. **Window Management**: We set the viewport size to maximize the window.\n7. **Form Interaction**: We fill in the username and password fields using `page.fill()`.\n8. **Button Click**: We click the login button using `page.click()`.\n9. **Assertion**: We verify the page title using `expect()`.\n\nThis code follows best practices with clear comments and proper structure, making it easy to understand and execute for anyone new to Playwright."
